## Flailab-fe (formerly known as omicsbase-front)

This react based website was written for the Lai lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering
to help manage their biological metadata. As their lab's primary focus is on fruit flies,
the name flai-lab seemed like a perfect fit.

The site can be visited [here](https://flailab.com).

The back end code for this site can be found [here](https://github.com/Phioria/flailab-be).
